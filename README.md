# Hand-Gesture-recognition-using-Raspberry-pi
Hand gesture recognition on a Raspberry Pi uses a camera and libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe. OpenCV handles video capture, while MediaPipe detects hand landmarks and gestures. Python integrates these tools for real-time gesture recognition, enabling interactive applications and control systems in tech and robotics projects.
